It includes the explanation of how the solution will address the identified problem or opportunity and what benefits it will bring.\r\n\r\nThe process of &quot;Solution Described&quot; typically includes several key steps:\r\n1. Identify the problem or opportunity: Clearly defining the problem or opportunity that the solution will address.\r\n2. Research and analyze: Gathering and analyzing data and information related to the problem or opportunity, including researching existing solutions and best practices.\r\n3. Solution development: Developing the proposed solution, which may include creating a concept, a detailed design, or a prototype.\r\n4. Solution description: Clearly and concisely describing the proposed solution and how it will address the problem or opportunity. This includes the explanation of how the solution works, what benefits it will bring, and how it will be implemented.\r\n5. Solution validation: Validating the solution through testing or piloting to ensure that it will work as intended and that it will bring the expected benefits.\r\nIt&#39;s important to note that &quot;Solution Described&quot; is also an ongoing process, as the solution may need to be refined or modified as the project progresses.\r\nOverall, &quot;Solution Described&quot; is a critical step in the project management and product development process, as it helps to ensure that the proposed solution is clear, feasible, and meets the needs of the stakeholders. It also helps to ensure that the solution is aligned with the organization&#39;s goals and objectives and that it will bring the expected benefits. It is also important for communicating the solution to stakeholders, investors, and other parties involved in the project.","how":"Taking all of the requirements, needs, maturity assessment uisng specialist technical resources create a solution that achieves the customer goals.

It involves taking the high-level requirements that have been defined in the early stages of the project, and breaking them down into more specific and granular requirements that can be used to guide the development of the solution. The process of breaking down high-level requirements typically involves working with stakeholders, including business and IT teams, to identify the specific needs and requirements of the organization. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as interviews, workshops, and questionnaires. During this process, detailed stakeholder requirements are captured and documented. These requirements should be specific, measurable, and testable, and should be aligned with the overall strategy and objectives of the organisation. They should also take into account any constraints, such as budget, timeline, and technical limitations. Capturing detailed stakeholder requirements is an iterative process, and may involve several revisions as the solution is further developed and refined. It is important to review and validate the requirements with all stakeholders, including business and IT teams, and to get their buy-in and approval before proceeding to the next phase of the project. Once the detailed stakeholder requirements are captured and approved, they serve as the foundation for the design and development of the solution.

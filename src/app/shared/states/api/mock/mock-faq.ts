        answerTranslation:
            'The Deal Lifecycle Framework (DLF) is the default framework for all Managed Services opportunities. Technique is used to manage projects and change activity for standalone customer projects, change projects within a Managed Service and will co-exist with DLF when there is a transformation element (Project) within the Managed Service Transition.'

        answerTranslation:
            'Technique has two types of tasks at the lowest level. These tasks are defined as Quality Checkpoints and Value Audits. The Quality Checkpoints are tasks that follow an internal process and provide internal output. The Value Audits are Customer facing processes and outputs. The Quality Measurement will align to these tasks as well as aligning to current governance and assurance activities defined by our policies and procedures.'

        answerTranslation:
            "Group Opportunity Governance (GOG) processes are part of Technique and are identified through the Quality Checkpoint (QC) within the required phase. Supporting Artefacts that are required for the GOG process are linked through the QC's."

        answerTranslation:
            'The key difference is that a Value Audit (VA) is customer facing and a Quality Checkpoint (QC) is CC Internal. They are both tasks and review points which are completed as part of that Activity, the VA also covers the customer interaction and output.'

        answerTranslation:
            'There will be no direct link provided between Technique to Salesforce. The required artefact data that is needed to fulfil the tasks within Technique and allow the output artefacts to be completed, have been mapped and defined within the Framework.'

            'If a customer requests that we use their framework (and it covers everything required) then that would take priority and all of the customer interaction would be using their framework. This would need to be agreed as part of the project governance. We may still need to use some elements of Technique internally to complete all of our required activities.'

            'There will be no charge to the customer for the use of Technique, the framework is our IP and used to deliver value to the customer based on the requirements and outcomes agreed within the scope of the engagement. Technique is designed to drive the opportunity to charge the customer for our knowledge, experience and consultative skills earlier in the sales cycle.'

            'How you enter the framework will depend on the scenario you are working with. If it is a new customer then you would generally start in Understand. If there is a managed Services contract in place and the activities would start in the Improve phase.

            "There are several types of change within TechniqueProject change management - manging change to the project scope (using RFCs)Contract change management - this is where there is a contractual change which amends the overall contract (possibly a Managed Services Framework). This type of change is managed using a Contract Change Notice (CCN).Business Change management - This is the type of change which impacts our customers' business / end user and can include organisation, technology and process changes among others. This type of change should utilise an Adoption and Change Management approach to ensure that the business change is effectively and therefore successfully implemented."

            "The project deliverables are based on the agreed requirements, scope of the contract and the designed solution. The outputs are defined as Customer Value Audits (VA's) and Quality Checkpoints (QC's) internal outputs. The deliverables therefore need to utilise the outputs from these defined tasks, utilising the aligned artefacts that all meet the requirements and contracted outcome for the project."

        answerTranslation:
            'The Technique framework uses roles rather than Computacenter job descriptions. This is because a role could be fulfilled by different job descriptions depending on the scenario in place at the time. The overall mapping of roles to job descriptions is available in the Framework platform.'

            'The artefacts required are based on the required phases, approaches and tasks required for the project. The artefacts are linked to tasks at a Quality Checkpoint (QC) and Value Audit (VA) task level. These levels describe the input and output artefacts required to complete those tasks.'

            'The Technique framework has been designed to be flexible and while there is an overall principle that the methods and approaches are in order this does not always apply. The sequencing of methods and approaches will depend on the exact scenario in place at the time.

            'Within an approach the Value Audits (VAs) will be shown first as these are customer facing. After this the Quality Checkpoints (QCs) are listed.

        answerTranslation:
            'There no specific gates within the framework, but there are logical steps that an engagement and project will follow. The completion of the required tasks at and Value Audit and Quality checkpoint level indicate that accountable role can move forward or handover to the next activity.'

            'In the contract, clearly outline the value drivers and how your product  or service delivers on them. This could be part of the description of  the product or service, or it could be included in a separate section  about the benefits or value proposition. In sales, there are certain artefacts that can serve as a basis for this, such as plan to win, podium customer review, etc.'

        answerTranslation:
            'Innovation means the introduction of something new. This "new" can vary form incremental, substantial to radical new for the user. They are characterised by a clear originality and a noticeable user benefit. Innovation are often driven by new technologies or new solutions to problems. Whether something is an innovation (i.e. new) depends on the maturity of the company concerned. Every innovation begins with a new idea or ideation phase. The commercialisation of an idea makes an innovation. What happens after an innovation, is transformation - the implementation process following the new solution.'

        answerTranslation:
            "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be set up, as required, for each project. Depending on the KPIs chosen, these will support governance and communication during the project (internally and externally). They will help to demonstrate performance of many areas such as progress of deliverables and finances against the overall plan and can also be at a strategic level within the customer's business. The VA and QC for KPIs in Technique can support you in determining these."

Requirements are first considered within theUnderstand phase where both high level and detailed requirements are gathered.Requirements are then further broken down, confirmed with the customer andprioritised within the Innovate phase.

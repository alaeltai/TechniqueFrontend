        question: 'Are Technique Artefacts and terminology aligned to the DLF?',

        answer: 'Where possible we have tried to use common artefacts that are in use within the business. There are several artefacts that are common to both Deal Lifecycle and Technique. In the future it is planned to develop more common, integrated and automated artefacts across the business.'

        question: 'Are the methods and approaches in Technique following a logical order?',

        answer: 'The Technique framework has been designed to be flexible and while there is an overall principle that the methods and approaches are in order this does not always apply. The sequencing of methods and approaches will depend on the exact scenario in place at the time. A key example of this is when there is a Managed Service in place, then most activities would start in the Improve phase.'
    },

    {
        id: 2,

        question: "Are the VA's and QC's in Technique following a logical order?",

        answer: 'Within an approach the Value Audits (VAs) will be shown first as these are customer facing. After this the Quality Checkpoints (QCs) are listed. Within the lists of VAs and QCs these are generally in order, however it will depend on the scenario in place at the time as to how these are carried out.'

    {
        id: 3,

        question: 'Are there any specific checkpoints within Technique to ensure quality is managed?',

        answer: 'Technique has two types of tasks at the lowest level. These tasks are defined as Quality Checkpoints and Value Audits. The Quality Checkpoints are tasks that follow an internal process and provide internal output. The Value Audits are Customer facing processes and outputs. The Quality Measurement will align to these tasks as well as aligning to current governance and assurance activities defined by our policies and procedures.'

        id: 4,

        question: 'Are we required to complete the activity within every method and approach?',

        answer: 'The framework is built using a modular approach and therefore can be tailored for the specific needs of the project and dictated by the in scope activities. Therefore only the required phases, approaches and tasks are needed that align to completing the outcome for the scope of the project.'
    },

    {
        id: 5,

        question: 'Can I tick off the tasks I have completed?',

        answer: 'Tasks can be ticked off locally against the required elements of Technique that are required to complete the project. Currently this will not be available within the Platform but a locally generated view can be used to refer to.'

        id: 7,

        question: 'How are job titles mapped to roles within the framework?',

        answer: 'The Technique framework uses roles rather than Computacenter job descriptions. This is because a role could be fulfilled by different job descriptions depending on the scenario in place at the time. The overall mapping of roles to job descriptions is available in the Framework platform.'

    {
        id: 8,

        question: 'How can I present the importance of value drivers into the customer contract?',

        answer: 'In the contract, clearly outline the value drivers and how your product  or service delivers on them. This could be part of the description of  the product or service, or it could be included in a separate section  about the benefits or value proposition. In sales, there are certain artefacts that can serve as a basis for this, such as plan to win, podium customer review, etc.'
    },

    {
        id: 9,

        question: 'How do I know where I should enter the framework?',

        answer: 'How you enter the framework will depend on the scenario you are working with. If it is a new customer then you would generally start in Understand. If there is a managed Services contract in place and the activities would start in the Improve phase. There are other factors which impact the entry point such as:scope of work (i.e. is design or deploy only)complexityhow well we know the customerThe Technique platform will guide you and help you select the appropriate methods, approaches and activities.'

    {
        id: 10,

        question: 'How do I know who is involved in each approach and who is specifically responsible for the outcome?',

        answer: 'All methods and approaches are mapped to one person or team. Of course, the task can be delegated, but the responsibility remains the same.'
    },

    {
        id: 11,

        question: 'How do we manage our vendors/suppliers/partners in the framework, especially when the design is done by the vendor?',

        answer: 'Should the design meet our standards, then we can take over. Our framework thus offers a kind of quality check whether our manufacturers have thought of everything that is necessary for us as a professional service business.'
    },

    {
        id: 12,

        question: 'How often will requirements be considered and checked within the Framework?',

        answer: 'Requirementsare considered within every phase in Technique, across 20 different ValueAudits and Quality Checkpoints. Requirements are first considered within theUnderstand phase where both high level and detailed requirements are gathered.Requirements are then further broken down, confirmed with the customer andprioritised within the Innovate phase. During the Execute phase, requirementsare verified and managed. The process of identifying and confirming high leveland detailed requirements is then introduced again within the Improve phase. Requirements are recorded and managed using the Professional Services Requirements tracker.'

    {
        id: 13,

        question: 'How will results and information be transferred from one phase to another, will there be specific gates between each phase?',

        answer: 'There no specific gates within the framework, but there are logical steps that an engagement and project will follow. The completion of the required tasks at and Value Audit and Quality checkpoint level indicate that accountable role can move forward or handover to the next activity.'

        id: 14,

        question: 'How will we be able to access the Sales Artefacts suggested in the framework if we do not have access to Sales Force?',

        answer: 'There will be no direct link provided between Technique to Salesforce. The required artefact data that is needed to fulfil the tasks within Technique and allow the output artefacts to be completed, have been mapped and defined within the Framework.'
    },

    {
        id: 15,

        question: 'If transform project sign off is not granted, where do I restart in the Framework?',

        answer: 'If Project sign off is not granted then it should be raised as a project issue and managed through the issue management process, alongside project governance. If it cannot be resolved within the project then the project may need to be placed into exception for the issues to be addressed at the correct level. It will depend on the outcome of the issue or exception management as to where you would restart in the framework.'
    },

    {
        id: 16,

        question: 'Is Opportunity Governance within the framework or is do we manage this separately?',

        answer: "Group Opportunity Governance (GOG) processes are part of Technique and are identified through the Quality Checkpoint (QC) within the required phase. Supporting Artefacts that are required for the GOG process are linked through the QC's."

        id: 17,

        question: 'Is there visibility of project deliverables within Technique?',

        answer: "The project deliverables are based on the agreed requirements, scope of the contract and the designed solution. The outputs are defined as Customer Value Audits (VA's) and Quality Checkpoints (QC's) internal outputs. The deliverables therefore need to utilise the outputs from these defined tasks, utilising the aligned artefacts that all meet the requirements and contracted outcome for the project."

        id: 18,

        question: 'Once initiation handover to delivery unit is complete, whom do we handover to?',

        answer: 'The full project resourcing model and project plan would be confirmed during initiation and this will determine who is responsible for each activity. The Project Lead is accountable throughout the project for project resources, however depending on the deliverables activity may be assigned to other teams, external sub contractors or even the customer. When handing over to a business as usual / delivery / support team the full acceptance into service process should be followed.'

        question: 'What are the different types of change management in Technique?',

        answer: "There are several types of change within TechniqueProject change management - manging change to the project scope (using RFCs)Contract change management - this is where there is a contractual change which amends the overall contract (possibly a Managed Services Framework). This type of change is managed using a Contract Change Notice (CCN).Business Change management - This is the type of change which impacts our customers' business / end user and can include organisation, technology and process changes among others. This type of change should utilise an Adoption and Change Management approach to ensure that the business change is effectively and therefore successfully implemented."

        question: 'What is meant by innovation?',

        answer: 'Innovation means the introduction of something new. This "new" can vary form incremental, substantial to radical new for the user. They are characterised by a clear originality and a noticeable user benefit. Innovation are often driven by new technologies or new solutions to problems. Whether something is an innovation (i.e. new) depends on the maturity of the company concerned. Every innovation begins with a new idea or ideation phase. The commercialisation of an idea makes an innovation.  What happens after an innovation, is transformation - the implementation process following the new solution.'

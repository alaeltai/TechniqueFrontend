It is an important step in the planning and execution of any project, as it ensures that the project will deliver value to the customer. A need is an essential requirement or a necessity and not the same as a want (see also "Wants understood"). The fulfilment of needs is essential for the customer as it solves a urgent problem or is critical for his success. The task "needs understood" is an ongoing process throughout the project, as stakeholders needs may change as the project progresses. Therefore, it is mentioned in many phases of the framework. It also helps to avoid misunderstandings, delays, and rework in later stages of the project.',

                                            'Assumptions verified&quot; refers to the process of evaluating and validating the assumptions that have been made during the development of a project or solution. Assumptions are statements or beliefs about something that is taken to be true, but that have not yet been proven or confirmed. They are often made during the planning phase of a project or when developing a solution, and they can have a significant impact on the success of the project or solution.It&#39;s important to note that &quot;Assumptions verified&quot; is an ongoing process, as new assumptions may be made or existing assumptions may change as the project or solution progresses.\r\nOverall, &quot;Assumptions verified&quot; is a critical step in the project management and product development process, as it helps to ensure that the project or solution is based on accurate and valid information. It also helps to identify and mitigate potential risks and to ensure that the project or solution is aligned with the organization&#39;s goals and objectives. Additionally, it helps to increase the transparency and accountability of the project and solution.',

The internal stakeholders are the parties or groups that are within the organization and are directly impacted by the project or initiative. The "internal kick-off" is typically led by a project lead or the person in charge of the initiative and it is an opportunity for the project team to introduce themselves, provide an overview of the project or initiative, and set expectations for the internal stakeholders. It also provides an opportunity for the stakeholders to ask questions, provide feedback, and raise any concerns they may have. Conducting an internal kick-off is an important step in the project management process, as it helps to ensure that all internal stakeholders are aware of the project, understand their roles and responsibilities, and have the opportunity to provide input and feedback. It also helps to build a sense of ownership and commitment among the internal stakeholders and establish a clear and transparent line of communication throughout the project. Overall, "Internal kick-off conducted" is an important step in the project management process, it helps to ensure that all internal stakeholders are aware of the project, understand their roles and responsibilities,projekt goverance and have the opportunity to provide input and feedback.

It should be inspiring and provide direction for the entire project team.\r\n\r\nThe new strategy refers to the approach that the project team will take to achieve the design vision. This includes identifying the key steps that need to be taken, the resources that will be needed, and the timelines for completion. The objectives are specific, measurable, and actionable goals that the project team needs to achieve in order to successfully implement the new strategy. These objectives should align with the overall design vision and strategy, and should be clearly communicated to all members of the project team. Capturing the design vision, new strategy, and objectives is an important step in the design phase of a project, as it helps to ensure that the project is on track to achieve its goals and that all team members understand what they need to do in order to be successful. This helps to align the team and focus on the desired outcome.',

It helps to understand what is driving the change and what are the underlying reasons that are causing the need for the change. It\'s important to note that "change drivers validated" is also an ongoing process, as new change drivers may be identified and need to be added to the list. Overall, "change drivers validated" is a critical step in the change management process, as it helps to ensure that the proposed changes are based on sound reasoning and that they will address the underlying issues that are driving the need for change. It also helps to ensure that the changes are aligned with the organisation\'s goals and objectives and that they will bring the expected benefits. It also helps to ensure that the stakeholders are aware of the reason for change and are on board with the change initiative.',

It involves taking the high-level requirements that have been defined in the early stages of the project, and breaking them down into more specific and granular requirements that can be used to guide the development of the solution. The process of breaking down high-level requirements typically involves working with stakeholders, including business and IT teams, to identify the specific needs and requirements of the organization. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as interviews, workshops, and questionnaires. During this process, detailed stakeholder requirements are captured and documented. These requirements should be specific, measurable, and testable, and should be aligned with the overall strategy and objectives of the organisation. They should also take into account any constraints, such as budget, timeline, and technical limitations. Capturing detailed stakeholder requirements is an iterative process, and may involve several revisions as the solution is further developed and refined. It is important to review and validate the requirements with all stakeholders, including business and IT teams, and to get their buy-in and approval before proceeding to the next phase of the project. Once the detailed stakeholder requirements are captured and approved, they serve as the foundation for the design and development of the solution. They help to ensure that the solution is developed to meet the needs and requirements of the organisation, and that it is aligned with the overall strategy and objectives of the organisation.',

It serves as a roadmap for the project team, outlining the steps that need to be taken to achieve the projects goals.\r\n\r\nThe cost plan, on the other hand, estimates the costs associated with the project, including materials, labour, and overhead. It also includes information on how the project will be financed and any contingencies that have been considered. During the verification process, the project and cost plans are reviewed by project managers, financial analysts, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, realistic, and in line with the projects goals. This may involve reviewing historical data, conducting market research, and consulting with experts in the field. Verifying the project and cost plans is an important step in the project management process, as it helps to ensure that the project is financially viable and that the project team has a clear understanding of the resources and timelines required to achieve the projects objectives. It also helps to identify any potential issues or risks that may impact the projects success, and allows for adjustments to be made before the project is fully underway.',

They ensure that the design is in line with the project's scope, goals and objectives, as well as any constraints and requirements that have been established. This step is important because it helps to ensure that the solution is technically sound, and that it will meet the needs of the users, while also ensuring that the solution is feasible to implement and maintain. This process also helps to identify any potential issues or risks that may impact the project's success, and allows for adjustments to be made before the solution is fully implemented. The acceptance process may include a formal review and approval process, with sign-offs from relevant parties, and a testing phase to ensure that the design meets the requirements and is functional as expected. Once the design is accepted, the implementation phase can begin.",

Management: Once stakeholders are identified, the next step is to manage their expectations, communication, and engagement throughout the project or organisational initiative. This involves developing and maintaining positive relationships, understanding their needs and concerns, and ensuring their involvement in key decision-making processes.\r\n3. Mapping: Stakeholder mapping is a visual representation of stakeholders; relationships and interdependencies. This helps to understand their level of influence, interests, and potential impact on the project or organisation. Mapping can also be used to identify potential areas of conflict and to develop strategies to manage these conflicts effectively.\r\nBy effectively identifying, managing and mapping stakeholders, organisations can ensure that they have the support and buy-in needed to successfully achieve their goals and deliver results.',

The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that issues are addressed in a timely and effective manner, and that decision-makers are informed and engaged as needed.\r\nSetting up an executive review and escalation procedure typically involves the following steps:\r\n1.Define the process: Establish clear guidelines and steps for how issues will be identified, documented, and escalated to the appropriate level of management.\r\n2.Identify decision-makers: Determine who will be involved in the review and escalation process, such as project managers, department heads, or senior executives.\r\n3.Define escalation criteria: Specify the criteria that will trigger an escalation, such as critical issues that require immediate attention, budget or timeline concerns, or disagreements among stakeholders.\r\n4.Establish communication channels: Ensure that the process includes clear and effective communication channels for documenting and discussing issues, such as regular status meetings, email updates, or an online tracking system.\r\n5. Monitor and evaluate the process: Regularly review and assess the effectiveness of the executive review and escalation procedure, and make adjustments as needed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nBy having a well-defined and effective executive review and escalation procedure in place, organizations can ensure that issues are dealt with quickly and effectively, and that the right people are involved in decision-making processes. This can help to minimize risks, improve project outcomes, and increase overall organisational performance.',

Objectives provide direction, focus, and motivation for achieving desired outcomes, and help to prioritise and allocate resources effectively.\r\nThe process of identifying objectives typically involves the following steps:\r\n1. Determine the purpose: Clarify the purpose of the organisation or project, and determine what needs to be accomplished.\r\n2. Assess the situation: Evaluate the current state of the organisation or project, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\r\n3.Involve stakeholders: Involve relevant stakeholders, such as employees, customers, or partners, in the process of identifying objectives to ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.\r\n4.Set SMART objectives: Set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) objectives that clearly define what needs to be achieved, how it will be accomplished, and when it will be completed.\r\n5.Prioritise objectives: Prioritise objectives based on their level of importance, urgency, and feasibility, and allocate resources accordingly.\r\nBy following this process, organisations can ensure that their objectives are aligned with their overall strategy and goals, and that they have a clear plan for achieving desired outcomes. This can lead to improved performance, increased efficiency, and better results.',
